## Create a simple automation builder

The goal of that exercice is to create an automation builder containing nodes (that could be actions) and edges (to link nodes with each other) using the code in this repo.

This repo uses:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) (React, Typescript)
- [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/learn)
- CSS (in order to keep it simple)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
nvm use
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
